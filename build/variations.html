Each level has a different set of restrictions, and there are fewer and fewer restrictions as we advance. The types of HTML and CSS elements I was allowed to use in each level are displayed when upon hover over the respective column.</div><div class="block video-block"><video autoplay muted loop><source src="/christine/variations.mp4#t=0.001" type="video/mp4"></video><div class="block text-block">This project, which was an assignment for a class, was particularly interesting to me because it got me thinking a lot about the concept of "pushing from exhaustion."</div><div class="block text-block">Especially in the beginning when all I had to work with were a few basic html elements, I felt quite frustrated and lost, because I was very accustomed to abundance and did not really believe that I would be able to produce any interesting visuals with such simple tools. I spent a while thinking about what I could possibly do to make this assignment work for me.</div><div class="block text-block">I ended up being quite surprised at what I was able to create and learn from this process, as I found myself experimenting with effects that, despite using only simple elements, led to interesting results. One of my favorites is these two variations, which work as a pair. In this first one, in which I was only able to utilize HTML elements and was prohibited from using CSS, I bolded every other letter in the poem by manually placing the bolded letters in a "strong" tag. Despite how simple and mindless the work was, it took quite a bit of time to go through the entire poem and wrap half of the letters in a tag. It felt almost like a meditative exercise to me.</div><div class="block image-solo image-container"><img src="/christine/strong.png"></div><div class="block text-block">Then, in a later step in the assignment where I was finally allowed to use more elements and even css, I used this as an opportunity to build on the html file I had previously created. Using CSS, I essentially reversed the effect I had taken over an hour to create by reverting all letters to the same weight using only three lines of code. It was nearly instantaneous.</div><div class="block image-solo image-container"><img src="/christine/swan.png"></div><div class="block text-block">This process, although quite simple in the technical sense, was meaningful to me because it got me thinking about things in general that take a lot of work and difficulty to build, but can be reversed or disappear in a snap. Some things on my mind are cooking food + devouring, manmade infrastructure in the face of natural disaster, trust …"</div><div class="block text-block">I also named this one “swan” because it reminded me of how swans look very elegant and peaceful as they float across water, but their feet paddle extremely aggressively under the water where others cannot see. I felt that is similar to the HTML because the rendered page displays a basic poem without visible styling, but the source code displays otherwise …"</div><div class="block text-block">Some of the websites in this project appear pretty simple on the surface, but hold more conceptual meaning that was fun for me to think about while creating them. For some of them, looking at the source code might reveal some of the thought processes that went behind them.</div><div class="block text-block">This page, which I titled "book," works when the user puts two or more windows side by side:</div><div class="block image-solo image-container"><img src="/christine/book.jpeg"></div><div class="block text-block">This is another one of my favorites that I created in the first stage of the project — I attempted to mimic fill-justification done in manual typesetting by manually inserting non-breaking spaces where I would insert space blocks if I were to manually typeset the poem by hand using a letterpress.</div><div class="block image-solo image-container"><img src="/christine/typeset.png"></div><div class="block text-block">Here area few other highlights from the project:</div><div class="block image-solo image-container"><img src="/christine/overlap.png"></div><div class="block image-solo image-container"><img src="/christine/squish.png"></div><div class="block text-block">This project was created in Graphic Design: Link at Princeton University with Laurel Schwulst.</div></div><script src="/christine/project.c74302bedd5c191bb6d6.js"></script></div></body></html>
