My team chose to work with Hyojin for this project because we were captivated by her creative dance artistry, and thought her character would be interesting to translate into a Tinder profile.</div><div class="block text-block">We first had a shoot with Hyojin as we captured her dancing freestyle in Sewoon Sangga, a digital shopping complex in the heart of Seoul with a retro vibe, through photo and video. We wished to capture her doing what she loves the most: dancing.</div><div class="block text-block">We then had her utilize these images, along with some of her own, to craft a Tinder profile that best showcases her personality and interests. We documented the process as she uploaded images of her doing the things she loves, selected her interests, and filled out a bio about herself.</div><div class="block text-block">You can watch the final video below:</div><div class="block youtube-block"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bq1pT2-5Y9g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="block text-block">My responsibilities during this project included:<br>&#10023; casting the dancer<br>&#10023; scouting the indoor & outdoor locations and scheduling the time for filming & production<br>&#10023; overseeing video editing and production<br>&#10023; color correcting and retouching photoshoot images<br>&#10023; creating marketing graphics for Instagram and YouTube using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</div><div class="block text-block">The following are the marketing graphics I produced using images from the photoshoot that were used to announce the partnership on Instagram.</div><div class="block image-trio image-container"><img src="/christine/ig0.jpg"><img src="/christine/ig2.jpg"><img src="/christine/ig1.jpg"></div><div class="block text-block">Some images from the photo / video shoot:</div><div class="block image-trio image-container"><img src="/christine/film0.jpg"><img src="/christine/film1.jpg"><img src="/christine/film2.jpg"></div><div class="block text-block">Editing the images:</div><div class="block image-trio image-container"><img src="/christine/edit0.jpg"><img src="/christine/edit1.jpg"><img src="/christine/edit2.jpg"></div><div class="block text-block">This project was completed during my marketing internship at Tinder Korea.</div></div><script src="/christine/project.c74302bedd5c191bb6d6.js"></script></body></html>
